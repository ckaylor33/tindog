TinDog Starting Files
HTML & CSS project based on the concept of tinder - but only for dogs.
This was my first time using some more intermediate/advanced HTML and CSS - also the first time using bootstrap framework for some of the design and functionality elements.
Tried to make sure the site had some mobile friendly design and UX.
Bootstrap used for the pricing cards, buttons and carousel in the project.
